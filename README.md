# Flask URL Shortener

This project was made with the goal of creating a tinyurl-like tool that would allow users to open up several links at once by going to a single URL. 

I made this project in 8th grade and it doesn't run very smoothly, but if you are interested in checking it out, you can find a live version at [lfm.ronenjain.com](https://lfm.ronenjain.com).
